False Sharing: All cores write to different addresses in the same 32-byte block (block size = 2^5 = 32).

Expected Output:

High invalidations and bus transactions due to repeated downgrades (BUS_UPGR/BUS_RDX).

All writes trigger coherence actions, even though no data is truly shared.

Key Metric: High bus traffic (bytes transferred) from repeated block invalidations.
